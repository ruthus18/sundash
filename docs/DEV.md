### [TODO]

* user sessions
* component interface (refactor mad tech)
* schemas for signals and commands (intranet-bus like, but just TypeDict)
* find the format for communication description (need to draw...)
* layout controller
* define sundash modules (`sundash.ext._base`)
* theme customization, frontend folder management, adaptive layout out-of-box

### [REFLECTION]

* do i really need Parcel ???
* enable app live-update - parcel + uvicorn (watchdog)

### [EXT]

* tochka-auth
* vega
* three-js
* tables
* admin
* sqlite
* asyncpg
* pydantic
* docs-maker

---

### Ideas

* libs for classic admin panels (django replacement)
* custom dashboards (grafana replacement)
* trading monitoring tools (realtime portfolio management, control panel, etc...)
* abstract platform for interactive data management
* full-loaded trading terminals
* custom data visualization
* advanced admin (with building nested structure schema into table)
* user shared sessions (minimal working chat)
* 3d graphics
